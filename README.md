# Project-Charter-Document

Whenever we talk about data science, chances are we’ll first think of those fancy stuff like AI, deep learning, machine learning, Big data etc.

But nobody talks about documentation for one of the reasons that we all know — it doesn’t sound sexy (or it sounds so boring).

And I completely agree that documentation is often not one of the most interesting things for data scientists. But still, it’s importance is no less than other data science workflow, especially in terms of data science project management.

What is certain is that project documentation should be clear, relevant and up to date. This will ensure all project stakeholders are on the same page at the same time. Expectations, requirements, resources, and risks should be obvious to all from the outset.

Make documentation as clear and simple as possible. Document your workflow consistently when you’re doing your projects (not after your projects). Document for the sake of helping others to understand your workflow and code in order for them to reproduce your results in future — either to fix some bugs or make improvements. If possible, find someone to take a look at your documentation to make sure that others are able to follow your explanation.
